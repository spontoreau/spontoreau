### Hi ðŸ––

My name is Sylvain, I'm a french software developer for almost 13 years. For the past five years I have focused on [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a language I love and which has allowed me to write the french book ðŸ“– "[TypeScript - Notions fondamentales](https://www.editions-eni.fr/livre/typescript-notions-fondamentales-9782409021701)".
On the community side, I'm co-organizing the [Paris TypeScript](https://typescript.paris/) meetup with some friends and I'm also [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/fr-fr/PublicProfile/5003619) !

I have been passionate about web development since the beginning of my career, especially on the backend side. I enjoy crafting web services using my favorite patterns: **CQRS** and **Event Sourcing**. I also like **Agile** methodology, **eXtreme Programming** approach and **Behavior Driven Development**. On the cloud side I'm an AWS afficionado especially Serverless services like [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [Event Bridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/), ... Also I'm really a huge fan of [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) ! I like using [CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) for my Infra as Code and with GitHub Actions it's my favourite combination ðŸ˜Ž
